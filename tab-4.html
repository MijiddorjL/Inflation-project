        <h1>THE CASE STUDIES ON HYPERINFLATION IN ZIMBABWE</h1>

         <img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/41532566-SS_worst_inflation_cover.jpg?v=1434037676&w=717&h=403&ffmt=webp&vtcrop=y">
        <p> Gideon Gono, then governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, claimed that “traditional economics do not fully apply in this country,” and said “I am going to print and print and sign the money…because we need money.”</p>

       <p>Reasons for hyperinflation in Zimbabwe in year 2008-09 : </p>
        <ol>
        <p>Printing money beyond means:</p>
            <li>Government relied too much on seigniorage (printing money to finance deficit), high deficit between spending and revenue. </li>
            <li>Poor monetary and fiscal policies: Government spending beyond means on pensions and military deployments led to high fiscal deficit. </li>
            <li>No monetary independence of central bank.</li>
        <p>Declining economic activity:</p>
            <li>Government policies led to driving out foreign investors, also land reform polices crippled the agriculture sector. </li>
            <li>Lack of capital for business and high dependence on imports.</li>
            <li>Currency depreciation also lead to low foreign reserve and risk of expropriation.</li>
        <p> Widespread corruption:</p>
            <li>No transparency and accountability of government, suppressed opposition parties.</li>
        </ol>


<h1>THE CASE STUDIES ON CURRENT INFLATION TRENDS</h1>

    <h2>Reasons for currents trends in inflation </h2>

<ol>
    <li>High Government spending: The stimulus and income support given during the COVID-19 pandemic increased demand.</li>
    <li>Supply chain issues: The Covid pandemic stopped economic activity, and increased demand could not match supply post-lockdown.</li>
    <li>Higher wage: Increased economic activity post-pandemic increased demand for labor, which resulted in rising wages; this trend was prominent in the IT sector. Also, inflation expectations led workers to demand higher wages. </li>
    <li>Strong consumer demand: Post lockdown, as economic activity returned to normal, there was massive demand across the sectors. It resulted in increased demand, and with supply constraints, there was an increase in inflation. </li>
    <li>Slow policy responses: Central banks of most countries did not raise the interest rates earlier as they thought it might further decrease the growth rate. However, most central banks are very aggressive in raising interest rates. </li>
    <li>The Russian invasion of Ukraine increased the price of food and energy, as Ukraine is a significant food producer and Russia is a primary energy source for Europe. Supply chains were severely affected due to the ongoing Ukraine war, which resulted in inflation. </li>
</ol>


<h1>THE CASE STUDY ON STAGFLATION IN UNITED STATES DURING 1970s</h1>

<p>The United States experienced a combination of high inflation and slow economic growth during 1970s. The inflation rate reached a peak of 13.5% in 1980, while the economic growth rate was very slow, averaging just 2.9% per year from 1973 to 1979. The stagflation was caused by a variety of factors:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Stagflation in the 1970s combined high inflation with disappointingly uneven economic growth.</li>
    <li>High budget deficits, low interest rates, oil embargos and the collapse of managed currency rates were among the main causes of stagflation.</li>
    <li>By letting high inflation expectations set in, the Federal Reserve raised the cost of bringing them under control later. </li>
    <li>The Fed under Paul Volcker raised interest rates above 19% to get inflation down, precipitating a steep economic downturn.</li>
    <li>Inflationary pressures subsequently eased as oil prices and union employment fell, limiting the growth of costs and wages.</li>
    <li> The stagflation led to a decline in living standards and a decrease in consumer confidence</li>
