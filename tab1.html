        <h2>What is inflation?</h2>
        <p>Inflation is the increase price level of goods and services in an economy, usually specified over a distinct period of time. When prices increase, money, in the affected currency, buys fewer goods and services. Inflation is measured by the inflation rate, which is the percentage change in a general price index (often referred to as the consumer price index) over a set amount of time.</p>

        <p>Inflation is caused by a variety of factors, including changes in the money supply, changes in government spending, and shifts in demand for goods and services relative to their supply. Central banks, such as the Federal Reserve in the United States, can use monetary policy to try to control inflation by adjusting the supply of money in the economy.</p>

      
        <h3>There are several factors that can cause inflation:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>1.  “Cost-push inflation”: If there is a decrease in the supply of goods and services due to factors such as natural disasters, wars, or trade restrictions, it can lead to an increase in prices. This is because the reduced supply of goods and services can lead to higher prices as people compete to buy them.</li>
            <li>2.  “Demand pull inflation”: If the demand for goods and services increases faster than the supply, it can lead to a general increase in prices. This is because increased demand can drive up the prices of goods and services.</li>
            <li>3.  “Expectations of future inflation”: If people expect that prices will increase in the future, they may start to demand higher wages which causes an increase in the cost to produce goods and services today, which is reflected in rising prices. This can lead to a self-fulfilling cycle of price increases.</li>

             <li>4. Increase in the money supply: If the central bank (such as the Federal Reserve in the United States) increases the supply of money in the economy faster than the increase in the supply of goods and services, it can lead to an increase in the general price level. This is because more money chasing the same number of goods and services can drive up their prices. (NOTE:THIS IS SOMEWHAT UNCLEAR, EXPLAIN HOW/WHY)</li>
            <li>5.  Increase in government spending: If the government increases its spending without a corresponding increase in the supply of goods and services, it can lead to an overall increase in prices. This is because the government is effectively competing with households and businesses for a limited supply of goods and services, which can drive up prices.</li>

     <h2>How inflation is measured</h2>
        <p>Inflation is typically measured using a price index, such as the consumer price index (CPI). The CPI is a measure of the average price of a selection of sample good and services consumed by households referred to by economists as a "consumer basket". To calculate the CPI, the prices of a representative selection of goods and services is tracked over time. The "basket" is designed to be representative of the purchases made by a typical urban consumer. To calculate the inflation rate, the price index is compared to a base year or period. For example, if the base year is set at 100, and the price index in the current year is 110, the inflation rate would be 10%. This means that the general price level has increased by 10% since the base year.</p>
